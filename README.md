# Scalable_datawarehouse_llm_finetuning

##Project overview

The primary goal of the project is likely to create a scalable data warehouse system specifically optimized for the finetuning process of a Large Language Model. This could involve improving efficiency in data ingestion, retrieval, and processing to enhance the performance of the LLM.Data will be collected from different sources and the collected data will undergo cleaning and processing to ensure its quality and relevance. It will be stored in a structured database, making it easily accessible for various NLP tasks. Additionally, APIs will be developed to facilitate seamless integration and querying of the dataset, enabling the company to leverage this resource effectively.
